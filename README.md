# All_Scenario_Hediffs

A small mod to let you add literally any hediff in the game to the scenario menu.

There is absolutely no care taken to filter out nonsensical hediffs, if you add a hediff that makes no sense that the game can't understand how to apply, that's not something I can fix, if you're enabling something that was explicitly not meant as a scenario hediff who knows what it'll do; maybe it'll disappear instantly or kill you, or just work it'd depend on the Hediff. This just saves you the effort of going and editing the scenarioCanAdd tags in the xml files.

You could just add `<scenarioCanAdd>true</scenarioCanAdd>` to the hediff xml file, but this is in game so hopefully a bit easier.

# Why did you make this
Someone in discord asked how to make Scaria addable because we've done it in mods several times before. So I said, you know what... hold my ~~beer~~ tea.
